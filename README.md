# supahands-coding-test
This is the coding test for prospective supahands engineers

# Problem Statement
Dutch and Dylan (D&D) have just met up at a jungle retreat to go on a hunt.
At a node, D&D can decide to either rest or hunt. D&D have stamina. Hunting, resting, and traveling to a new node consumes 1 time unit each. They start the hunt with 3 stamina, and resting returns 0-2.
The graph is undirected, D&D can traverse back and forth between nodes. D&D can either hunt together or split up. 
A node can only be either hunted in or rested in before exhausted, hunters cannot interact with exhausted nodes. Hunting has a 10%(20% if solo) chance of causing injuries. An uninjured hunter has a 50%(60% if solo) chance of bagging a prey, an injured hunter has 30%.
Resting cures all injuries. A hunter can only have 2 injuries before becoming crippled and unable to participate in the hunt and forced to rest. 
A crippled hunter can only travel to a new node or rest. When the time unit runs out, they will get to the chopper and the hunt ends. (This doesn't need to be modeled)

# Output
The number of prey bagged, we're going to do a STDOUT test against an integer number to determine if the engineer has passed the test.

# Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Solve the appropriate version of the test, be it python, ruby or js.
3. Make a fork, and then create a PR for the fork when you are ready for answer submission!
